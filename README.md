Abstract
Abstract
This study aims to develop a Text to Pictogram translation system which is used to convert a French text into its
corresponding pictogram terms. The proposed system demonstrates the effectiveness of a transformer-based
model in translating French text into meaningful pictogram sentences. Google-T5 is utilized and further fine-tuned
on a custom dataset of French text to predict corresponding pictogram terms in French. The model underwent
fine-tuning across multiple epochs to optimize performance. Additionally, the trained model was iteratively
fine-tuned to enhance its translation capabilities. Metrics like PictoER score, BLEU score and METEOR score
were used to assess the modelâ€™s performance. The proposed model achived a PictoER score of 13.9, BLEU score of
74.3 and a METEOR score 87.0.
